Homework week 4
In this challenge, data pertaining to schools within a district were analyzed in a variety of scenarios.  

##District Summary:

This data set is a high-level overview of the district conveying the total number of schools and their students, the total district budget, and average test scores.  This data alone provides a baseline for the independent performance of the data to come

##School Summary:

This data provides the same basic statistics as the district summary by school. In this view the assumption begins to manifest that while Charter Schools are budgeted similarly on a per student basis, the percentages of students passing overall appears greater than those of the district schools.

##Top Performing Schools/Bottom Performing Schools:

The assumption that Charter Schools were out-performing the district schools become more apparent when viewing the top 5 and bottom 5 schools in the district when compared by percentage of students who passed both math and reading.  The top 5 are all Charter Schools and the bottom 5 are all District.  Total students range from 962-2,283 in Charter Schools while they range from 2,917-4,761 in the District Schools.

##Scores by Grade:

When the scores by grade are viewed without regard to the school type, each school appears homogenous irrespective of grade.  On average, the students at each school do not improve from year to year, if not by negligible amounts.

##Scores by Spending per Student

This view illuminates a stronger justification for the assumption that school spending does not equate to better test scores.  In fact, the least funded schools (under $584 per student) are passing %90.37 of the time.

##Scores by School Size:

This view also begins to illuminate another assumption:  The schools with over 2000 students are far lower in percentage of students Passing Overall at only %58.29 and also low in percentage of students Passing Math at %69.96.

##Scores by School Type

In the end, the assumption that Charter Schools have greater success than the District Schools in this district at %90.43 passing overall vs. %53.67 at District Schools.  This can be assumed to be the result of smaller student body sizes rather than a greater budget as supported by the Scores by Spending and Scores by Number of Students data sets.
